# BW-16--BLE
Development and Learning of BW-16 BLE Capabilities and Functionality

## Coding Variations:

1) BW-16 variation of the Bletubushi code (https://github.com/Mauddib28/Bletsubushi)
2) BW-16 BLE GATT Server to provide GPS Coordinates
3) BW-16 BLE GATT Server for debugging
	- Note: Can be used as training device for BLEEP (https://github.com/Mauddib28/bleep-tool)

## Compiling Code:

CLI Command to Compile:     arduino-cli compile --fqbn realtek:AmebaD:Ai-Thinker_BW16 --clean ./bw16__ble_audio_basic/bw16__ble_audio_basic.ino
